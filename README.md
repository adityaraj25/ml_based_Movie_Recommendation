📖 Introduction
In the age of digital streaming, users are overwhelmed by the vast number of movie choices available. This Movie Recommendation System aims to enhance the user experience by suggesting movies tailored to individual tastes. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and movie features to generate recommendations.

🚀 Features
🎥 Personalized Movie Recommendations
🔍 Content-Based Filtering
🤝 Collaborative Filtering
🧠 Hybrid Recommendation Approach
📈 Performance Metrics for Evaluation
🌐 Web Interface for User Interaction (Optional)
🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms
surprise – Collaborative filtering
Flask / Streamlit – Web application (optional)
matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
💾 Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/adityaraj25/ml_based_Movie_Recommendation.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv

📊 Dataset
Source: MovieLens Dataset
Description: Contains user ratings for movies, along with metadata like genres, release dates, and more.
Size: Varies depending on the dataset version (e.g., MovieLens 100K, 1M, etc.)
🧪 Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and handling missing values
Encoding categorical features (e.g., genres)
Normalizing rating values
Recommendation Techniques:

Content-Based Filtering:
Uses movie metadata (genres, directors, etc.) and cosine similarity to recommend movies similar to those the user liked.

Collaborative Filtering:
Uses the Surprise library for user-based and item-based collaborative filtering based on user ratings.

Hybrid Approach:
Combines both methods to improve accuracy and diversity of recommendations.

Model Evaluation:

Metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), Precision@K
Cross-validation to ensure model generalizability
✅ Results
Accuracy: Achieved an RMSE of X.XX and Precision@K of XX%.
User Feedback: Positive feedback on recommendation relevance during user testing.
🚀 Future Improvements
Incorporate deep learning techniques (e.g., Neural Collaborative Filtering)
Implement real-time recommendations with a dynamic web interface
Integrate with external APIs (e.g., TMDB) for richer movie metadata
Add user authentication for personalized experience
